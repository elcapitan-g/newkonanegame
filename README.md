# Overview
Kōnane- Hawaiian Checkers game in C++

I built this project to grow as a software engineer by practicing C++ programming. I wanted to make something interactive so I chose Kōnane(a traditional Hawaiian strategy game). This helped me understand how C++ handles logic, functions, loops, user input, and overall program structure.

This software lets players view a game board, make moves, jump pieces, and replay the game. My goal was to apply everything I learned about C++ syntax while building something that actually works.

This program  improved my coding skills, learned how to structure a larger project, and gave me experience with compiling and running C++ programs.
